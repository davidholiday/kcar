# K-car
### a factory for building and deploying Java microservices 

---

### what is this? 
K-car is the fastest way to create and deploy java microservices. It uses [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/), a 'message oriented middleware' Java toolkit to empower teams to deliver complex business logic in a way that turbo charges both velocity AND quality. Units of business logic (*elements*), collections of business logic (*routes*), and the service platform on which routes are deployed (*chassis*) are all 100% encapsulated. This allows engineers to work independently, for every element in the assembly to have its own robust set of tests, and for elements to be re-used without cutting and pasting source from one project to another. 

The project is called __K-car__ in honor of [Chrysler's K platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_K_platform) from which the philosophy of building complex machinery from a collection of standardized, encapsulated, components is derived.
